## Install Python on Windows

If you don't have Python installed on your Windows machine, you can install it [from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads).

To verify it's installed, create a new terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd>) and try running the following command:

```
python --version
```

You should see something similar to the following:
```
Python 3.9.5
```
For additional information about using Python on Windows, see [Using Python on Windows at Python.org](https://docs.python.org/3.10/using/windows.html).
